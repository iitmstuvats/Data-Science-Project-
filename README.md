# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Movie-Reviews

In the dataset each record represents a movie-review pair with movie title, description, genres, duration, director, actors, users' ratings, review text, reviewer name, etc. The files contain the ML model to predict sentiment of the review text.

### Process for building the model:
1. EDA
2. Data Cleaning (stopwords, lower, etc.)
3. Data Preprocessing (text into vectors, feature scaling, encoding)
4. Trained Models (Data Metrics, Hyperparameter Tuning, etc.)

### Applied 3 different ML Models
1. Logistic Regression (score:0.844)
2. Naive Bayes Classifier (score:0.823)
3. Linear SVC (score:0.847)

**Model Adopted : LINEAR SVC** (as it performed the best)
